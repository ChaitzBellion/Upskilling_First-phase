Upskilling_First-phase
The first phase of my Learning and Development plan and the projects I built for upgrading myself in data engineering.

Started my journey on 09-05-2025 by refreshing my skills in Python and focusing on learning the concepts of Machine Learning.

🧠 Profile Summary
🎓 Background: Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE)
💼 Current Role: ITSM Specialist (multiple accounts)
☁️ Cloud Experience: Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer
📊 Analytics: Experience with Power BI, Excel, and Google Analytics
🎯 Best-Fit Roles (Ranked for Me)
1. Data Engineer (Primary Recommendation)
Why it fits:

Cloud experience (especially GCP) is directly relevant.
Analytics + BI background — helpful in understanding data sources.
Already comfortable with data flows and can build on it.
Growth: Foundation for branching into ML, DataOps, or Big Data roles.

Next Steps:

Learn SQL + Python (if not already strong).
Hands-on with Apache Airflow, dbt, BigQuery (GCP native), and Cloud Storage.
Study data modeling and ETL pipelines.

2. DataOps Engineer (Secondary Recommendation)
Why it fits:

Ops-heavy ITSM environment experience.
GCP experience is useful for cloud-native DataOps tools.
Opportunity to combine infrastructure growth with data workflows.
Growth: Ideal if interested in automation and DevOps tools.

Next Steps:

Learn CI/CD for data pipelines (GitHub Actions + dbt or Airflow).
Learn monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana or GCP Cloud Monitoring.
Start containerization basics: Docker, GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
3. Data Quality Engineer
Why it fits:

Structured IT processes background helps with data validation policies.
Especially relevant for industries like healthcare and finance.
Next Steps:

Learn Great Expectations (Python library for data testing).
Study profiling tools (GCP Data Catalog, BigQuery table profiling).
Combine Power BI insights to validate backend data quality.
🤔 Roles to Approach Later or with Caution
Role	Reason
Big Data Engineer	Best after building foundational data engineering + Spark skills
Database Architect	Requires deep hands-on DB design + tuning expertise
Data Integration Specialist	Recommended after gaining broader experience
📚 Suggested Learning Path
Aim to complete these by October.

🔹 Core Skills to Strengthen Now
SQL (advanced queries, joins, window functions)
Python (for data wrangling, ETL — start with Pandas)
Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Dataflow basics)
🔹 Tools to Learn
Area	Tools
Data Pipelines	Apache Airflow (or GCP Cloud Composer), dbt
Monitoring	GCP Cloud Monitoring / Prometheus
ML Path	TensorFlow (as planned) + BigQuery ML
🏁 Final Recommendation
Start with Data Engineer — it aligns with my current cloud + analytics skills and opens the door to AI/ML (with TensorFlow) later.
Once comfortable, branch into DataOps or Data Quality, depending on what I enjoy more:

Infra/automation → DataOps
Governance/testing → Data Quality
🧭 Roadmap to Become a Data Engineer (with Cloud + TensorFlow Integration)
