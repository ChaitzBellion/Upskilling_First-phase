# Upskilling_First-phase
The first phase of my Learning and development plan and projects i built for upgrading myself.

Started my journey on 09-05-2025 With refreshing my skills in python. And concentrating and learning the concepts of machine learning.


🧠 Summary of my Profile
🎓 BackgroundECE (Electronics & Communication)💼 Current RoleITSM Specialist (multiple accounts)☁️ Cloud Experience - Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer📊 AnalyticsExperience with Power BI🧠 Learning Interest - Planning to learn TensorFlow (AI/ML path)📍 Target Industries - Healthcare, Finance; 🧰 Infra Knowledge - Some process knowledge, limited hands-on
🎯 Best-Fit Roles (Ranked for me)
✅ 1. Data Engineer (Primary Recommendation)
Why it fits:
Cloud experience (especially GCP) is directly relevant.
You have analytics + BI background — helpful in understanding data sources.
You’re already comfortable with data flows and can build on it.
Growth: Foundation for branching into ML, DataOps, or Big Data roles.
Next Steps:
Learn SQL + Python (if not already strong).
Hands-on with Apache Airflow, dbt, BigQuery (GCP native), and Cloud Storage.
Study data modeling and ETL pipelines.

✅ 2. DataOps Engineer (Secondary Recommendation)
Why it fits:
You're already working in an ops-heavy ITSM environment.
GCP experience is useful for cloud-native DataOps tools.
Could combine infrastructure growth with data workflows.
Growth: Helps if you’re also interested in automation and DevOps tools.
Next Steps:
Learn CI/CD for data pipelines (GitHub Actions + dbt or Airflow).
Learn monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana or GCP Cloud Monitoring.
Start containerization basics: Docker, GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

✅ 3. Data Quality Engineer
Why it fits:
Your background in structured IT processes can help implement data validation policies.
Works well in healthcare and finance industries where compliance and accuracy matter a lot.
Next Steps:
Learn Great Expectations (Python lib for data testing).
Study profiling tools (GCP Data Catalog, BigQuery table profiling).
Combine Power BI insights to validate backend data quality.

🤔 Roles to Approach Later or with Caution
Role Reason Big Data Engineer Best after I've built foundational data engineering + Spark skills Database Architect Requires deep hands - on DB design + tuning expertise Data Integration Specialist Requires deep tool expertise (Informatica, MuleSoft), not beginner-friendly unless guided
📚 Suggested Learning Path for Me. Which i need to complete them by October.
🔹 Core Skills to Strengthen Now
SQL (advanced queries, joins, window functions)
Python (for data wrangling, ETL — start with Pandas)
Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Dataflow basics)

🔹 Tools to Learn
Area Tools Data Pipelines Apache Airflow (or GCP Cloud Composer), dbt Monitoring GCP Cloud Monitoring / Prometheus ML Path - TensorFlow (which you already plan) + BigQuery ML
🏁 Final Recommendation
➤ Start with Data Engineer — it aligns with my current cloud + analytics skills and opens the door to AI/ML (with TensorFlow) later.
Once I am comfortable, branch into DataOps or Data Quality, depending on what i enjoy more:
Infra/automation → DataOps
Governance/testing → Data Quality
Custom Road plan for my goal.
Great! Here's a personalized roadmap to transition from your current ITSM role into a Data Engineer, with options to branch into DataOps or ML (TensorFlow) later. This roadmap assumes a 4–6 month timeline based on part-time learning.
